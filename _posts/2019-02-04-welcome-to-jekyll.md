The project demonstrates a delivery robot with autonomous capabilities, static, and dynamic obstacle avoidance. The robot will navigate to a conveyor belt to receive a package and will navigate through a map to deliver it between departments inside a warehouse with multiple levels, the robot can use elevator gazebo plugin to communicate, know the state and location of the elevator, and upon reaching the desired level/ floor, update the map. Finally, on reaching the goal the package will be delivered by the robotâ€™s conveyor belt.
